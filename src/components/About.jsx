        <p className="about-paragraph">
          I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science, blending a background in software engineering, machine learning, and computer graphics with a deep interest in generative AI and digital art. My work spans full-stack systems, 2D/3D art pipelines, and tools that bring creative ideas to life through code.
        </p>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
          I’ve worked on game content automation, AI-powered avatars, real-time rendering tools, and conversational bots — often bridging the gap between artist and engineer.
        </p>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
          Outside of code, I draw, paint, and explore ways to fuse technology with storytelling, emotion, and interaction.
